### About me

I am a Senior Software Engineer focused on iOS development. I am experienced with technologies such as UIKit, Swift UI, iOS Widgets, Combine, Swift Package Manager, Mac Catalyst and other tools.

At Stanford University, I created and taught the iOS Development course at Stanford Continuing Studies. My Wife and I wrote 4 books on iOS Development.

I have published 8 apps on to the App Store and am the creator of Swift Table.

My greatest skills are:
- Building new applications and software frameworks
- Leading engineering teams
- Introducing clean code and process improvements
- Teaching complex topics in a practical and simple way - for developers and non-technical audiences

Some of my most notable projects are the website for CA Notify (www.canotify.ca.gov) used by over 15 million people and proprietary software used to manage investments in the United States, China and Japan.
