### About me

I am a Senior Software Engineer focused on iOS development. I am experienced with technologies such as UIKit, Swift UI, iOS Widgets, Combine, Swift Package Manager, Mac Catalyst and other tools.

At Stanford University, I created and taught the iOS Development course at Stanford Continuing Studies.

My Wife and I wrote 4 books on iOS Development -  [Amazon Author Page](https://www.amazon.com/Benyam-Alemu-Sood/e/B09D2ZCHWG/ref=pd_sim_bl_sccl_1_1/000-0000000-0000000). I published 9 apps on the iOS and Android App Stores. 

I am the creator of [Swift Table](https://github.com/sivx76/Swift-Table) - an opensource library that reduces the hundreds of lines of code needed to build a TableView into just 3 lines. I also invented [Swift Carousel](https://github.com/sivx76/Swift-Carousel) - to present complex multimedia and onboarding experiences.

My greatest skills are:
- Building new applications and software frameworks
- Leading engineering teams
- Introducing clean code and process improvements
- Teaching complex topics in a practical and simple way - for developers and non-technical audiences

My other projects include the website for [CA Notify](www.canotify.ca.gov) used by over 15 million people and proprietary software used to manage investments in the United States, China and Japan.
